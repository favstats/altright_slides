**Milo Yiannopolous' characterization of the Alt-Right:** `\(^1\)`

&gt; *The alt-right is a movement born out of the youthful, subversive, **underground edges of the internet**. 4chan and 8chan are hubs of alt-right activity. For years, members of these forums – political and non-political – have delighted in **attention-grabbing, juvenile pranks**. Long before the alt-right, 4channers turned **trolling** the national media into an in-house sport.*

**Marwick and Lewis 2017**

&gt; *Term coined by Richard Spencer to describe a version of **white nationalism** that positions itself as comprised of **younger, wealthier, and better-educated individuals** than traditional white supremacist groups like the Klu Klux Klan. Deeply entwined with social media and staples of **internet culture, like memes**. Believes that **“political correctness” threatens individual liberty**. Example: Jared Taylor of the American Renaissance, Mike Cernovich of Danger and Play.*

**Hawley 2017**

&gt; *Using the loosest definition, we could say the Alt-Right includes anyone with right-wing sensibilities that **rejects the mainstream conservative movement**. But there are certain common, perhaps universal attitudes within the Alt-Right. The Alt-Right is **fundamentally concerned with race**. At its core, the Alt-Right is a white-nationalist movement, even if many (perhaps most) of the people who identify with the Alt-Right do not care for that term. The most energetic and significant figures of the movement want to see the creation of a **white ethnostate** in North America.*

**Non-ironic Nazism masquerading as ironic Nazism.**

## What is the Alt-Right?


A group of loosely aligned individuals and subgroups that predominately consist of white, young &amp; male frequent internet user. Although adherence to these beliefs varies, these are some common themes within the Alt-Right:

--

+ Antipathy towards both liberals (*“social justice warriors”*) and conservatives (*“cuckservatives”*) 

--

+ Fighting a *"culture war"* against perceived liberal consensus within the establishment

--

+ Belief that freedom of speech is being threatened by *"political correctness"*

--

+ Strong animosity towards feminism, multiculturalism and immigration (*"cultural marxism"*)

--

+ Belief in biological differences in between races and genders that justifies separate treatment

--

+ Ambiguous and troll-like behavior as to ensure *plausible deniability*

&lt;!-- ## What is the Alt-Right? --&gt;

&lt;!-- The Alt-Right consists of... --&gt;

&lt;!-- -- --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; an amalgam of conspiracy theorists, techno-libertarians, white nationalists, Men’s Rights advocates, trolls, anti-feminists, anti-immigration activists, and bored young people [...]. [S]ome participants in this ecosystem are organized by their beliefs (like *"Men’s Rights Activists"*), while others are organized by particular media or platforms (such as individual blogs and podcasts). Thus, the lines between these groups are always blurry and uneven (Marwick and Lewis 2017).  --&gt;

--

+ Comments from 6 Media Outlets (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, Fox News, Washington Post, New York Times)

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;img src="images/media.png" width="80%"&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

## Language Modeling: Toxicity

---

### Training Data

**TODO**

* update three slides
* animate toxicity on text

--

**Data Source**: Wikipedia comments annotated with **toxicity** scores avaible in as [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data). Five thousend crowd-workers were involved in labeling different toxicity and sub-types like personal attacks for approx. 160k comments. The dataset is documented [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox/Data_Release).

* balanced data to 30.000
* Text Normalization
* logo toxic/Jigsaw
* ask for other interesting datasets

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src = "../images/jigsaw.png" width = 200&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

### Predictions 

* different keras models
* confusion matrix

## Statistical Modeling

---

## modeling todos

* Multilevel Logit/Regression
    + fit1: shows difference in toxicity by user type (ar, media, mixed)
    + fit2: shows difference in toxicity by user type and media type (media_type): media and altright and mixed toxic comparison
    + fit3: shows keywords and associated toxicity by user type and media type 
    + fit4: shows likes, comments and shares toxicity by user type and media type 

*Maybe this but less important*

* Mean toxicity by page
* Keywords count (parrallel chart) on media and altright

## User Activity

### How do Media and Alt-Right interact online?

---

## User Activity ToDos

+ Flow of Toxicity (event toxicity)
  + implement event titles
  + data in file name
  + get average toxicity over time
  + plot a line chart below
  

*probably not*

+ How does the Alt-Right intersect with media? Timeline plots
    + What are days where the Alt-Righters came to the media? Why?

## Future Research

*Possible other applications:*

* How does the Alt-Right react to terror attacks

* Tracking stories and misinformation (like the hoax that two Syrian refugees were responsible for the Quebec Mosque Attack)

* Distinguishing between Alt-Light and Alt-Right content

## Conclusions

+ TODO TODO

---


## Conclusions

* Account for the *multidimensionality* of extremism
    + extremism is not only limited to hate speech, it's also ideological
    
    
* Taking complaints about ambiguity of hate speech seriously

* More accountable AI programming:
    + AI deletion: problems with uncertainty and ambiguity of language
    + Need for *human in the loop*
    + Include Feedback: possibility to appeal (restricted times)
    + Algorithms must be responsive and transparent
    + Highlight content in question and reasons
    + Cross-checking algorithms to reduce error rate
